To control the Pac-Man character, use the WASD keys. If you collide with a ghost, a life is deducted. The game in over when all three lives are lost. However, if the player collides with any of the four power-up pellets, the ghosts become scared/vulnerable and Pac-Man can eat them to gain points. The power-up doesn't last long however so careful not to chase too long. There is also a score that is implemented that allows the player to keep track of how well they are doing.

To resume press "start" again. To exit to the main home page, press "select". To play again from the lose screen, press "start" which will transfer the use back to the home screen.
